The project ABSTRACTION NOW presented current tendencies of non-representative art, particularly focused on audio-visual media and interdisciplinary aspects. Classical artistic genres such as painting and sculpture were confronted with modern digital forms of expression in an interdisciplinary manner. In this context, the in art theory highly over-strained concept of Abstraction functioned as common denominator with respect to content, and it referred to so far hardly considered conceptual interrelations between individual disciplines. The exhibition was accompanied and extended by a historical film program entitled MATHS IN MOTION, organized by sixpackfilm. The project ABSTRACTION NOW presented current tendencies of non-representative and non-figurative tendencies. All sorts of gesture-based, lyrical or expressive abstraction remained unconsidered, since mainly formal innovations and mediatechnological developments were centered. One of the main tasks of the exhibition was to indicate how artistic strategies of image-making have changed and expanded with the help of the new media, which specific logic is inherent to them and what consequence is applied to put them into action. Of special interest was the process-related aspect within abstract creation. A further focus is put on the comparison of Austrian and international artists; foremost a younger generation was presented.
