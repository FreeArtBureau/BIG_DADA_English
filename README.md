## BIG DADA

A series of Processing sketches that introduce some common approaches to working with data sets. These sketches were developed for a school project at l'Ã©sad d'Amiens, France. The project was based on thinking about how to use data in a different manner to how we usually use it. What does that mean? Well, instead of attempting to produce eye candy interactive or static data viz, what other ways can the designer use data? The project was in part intended to provoke discussion about the way we use, produce and represent data. It opened up critical thoughts on security, privacy, collaboration, the self, and mass online culture. 

These sketches in no way attempt to reveal anything about data. They demonstrate various methods for obtaining data with Processing.
