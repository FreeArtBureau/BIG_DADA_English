Processing Sketches for Graphic Designers

A series of Processing sketches that introduce some common approaches to working with data sets. These sketches were developed for a school project at l'Ã©sad d'Amiens, France. The project was based on thinking about how to use data in a different manner to how we usually use it. What does that mean? Well, instead of attempting to produce eye candy interactive or static data viz, what other ways can the designer use data? The project was intented to provoke discussion about the way we use, produce and represent data. It opened up critical thoughts on security, privacy, collaboration, the self, and mass culture. These sketches in no way attempt to reveal anything about data and serve as examples of how one can obtain data with Processing.
